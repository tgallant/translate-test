* Ensuring that the document is completely translated (translation memories do not accept empty target segments)
* Ensuring that the translated documents are consistent, including common definitions, phrasings and terminology. This is important when different translators are working on a single project.
* Enabling translators to translate documents in a wide variety of formats without having to own the software typically required to process these formats.
* Accelerating the overall translation process; since translation memories "remember" previously translated material, translators have to translate it only once.
* Reducing costs of long-term translation projects; for example the text of manuals, warning messages or series of documents needs to be translated only once and can be used several times.
* For large documentation projects, savings (in time or money) thanks to the use of a TM package may already be apparent even for the first translation of a new project, but normally such savings are only apparent when translating subsequent versions of a project that was translated before using translation memory.
