# Machine Translation

Neural machine translation (NMT) is an approach to machine translation that uses
an artificial neural network to predict the likelihood of a sequence of words,
typically modeling entire sentences in a single integrated model.

They require only a fraction of the memory needed by traditional statistical
machine translation (SMT) models. Furthermore, unlike conventional translation
systems, all parts of the neural translation model are trained jointly
(end-to-end) to maximize the translation performance.
